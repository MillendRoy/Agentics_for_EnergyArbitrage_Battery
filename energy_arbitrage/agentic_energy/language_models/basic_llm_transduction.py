                You are solving a daily battery scheduling optimization problem using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). 
                You are given a request object containing:
                - Hourly energy prices for buying and selling electricity.
                - Hourly electricity demand from a building or system.
                - Battery technical parameters including capacity_kwh: {battery_details.capacity_kwh}, charge/discharge power limits cmax_kw: {battery_details.cmax_kw}, dmax_kw: {battery_details.dmax_kw}, efficiencies - eta_c: {battery_details.eta_c}, eta_d: {battery_details.eta_d}, and state-of-charge soc_max: {battery_details.soc_max}, soc_min: {battery_details.soc_min} bounds.

                Your task is to:
                1. Determine the hourly charge , discharge, grid import, grid export, and SoC schedule for 24 hours.
                2. Minimize the total operational cost:
                    total_cost = Î£_t [ (price_buy[t] {req.day.prices_buy} * import_kw[t] - price_sell[t] {req.day.prices_sell} * export_kw[t]) * dt_hours {req.day.dt_hours} ]
                3. Ensure all constraints are satisfied:
                - SoC at time t = SoC at time t-1 + (eta_c {battery_details.eta_c} * charge_kw[t]  - discharge_kw[t] / eta_d {battery_details.eta_d}) * dt_hours {req.day.dt_hours} / capacity_kwh {battery_details.capacity_kwh}
                - soc_min {battery_details.soc_min} â‰¤ SoC_t â‰¤ soc_max {battery_details.soc_max} for all t
                - 0 â‰¤ charge_kw[t]  â‰¤ cmax_kw {battery_details.cmax_kw}
                - 0 â‰¤ discharge_kw[t] â‰¤ dmax_kw {battery_details.dmax_kw}
                - import_kw[t] = max(0, demand_kw[t] + charge_kw[t]  - discharge_kw[t] - export_kw[t])
                - export_kw[t] â‰¥ 0 only if allow_export {req.day.allow_export} = True
                - initialize the soc variable at soc_init {battery_details.soc_init} at t=0, where t is the first hour of the day.
                - The battery SoC at the end of the day should reach soc_target {battery_details.soc_target} (if provided), else soc_init {battery_details.soc_init}.
                - Assume the battery can either charge  or discharge or stay idle in a given hour, not both. So try to schedule the battery in such a way.

                4. Output a JSON-compatible SolveResponse object with:
                - status: "success" or "failure"
                - message: optional diagnostic
                - objective_cost: the minimized total cost
                - charge_kw: list of hourly charge values (kW)
                - discharge_kw: list of hourly discharge values (kW)
                - import_kw: list of hourly grid import values (kW)
                - export_kw: list of hourly grid export values (kW)
                - soc: list of hourly state of charge values (fraction of capacity between 0 and 1)

                Make sure the final schedule satisfies all physical constraints and the objective function is minimized.
