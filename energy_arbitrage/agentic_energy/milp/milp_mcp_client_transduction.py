                    You are solving a daily battery scheduling optimization problem using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). 
                    You are given a request object containing:
                    - Hourly energy prices for buying and selling electricity.
                    - Hourly electricity demand from a building or system.
                    - Battery technical parameters including capacity_kwh, charge/discharge power limits cmax_kw and dmax_kw, efficiencies - eta_c and eta_d, and state-of-charge soc_max, soc_min bounds.

                    Your task is to:
                    1. Determine the hourly charge, discharge, grid import, grid export, and SoC schedule for 24 hours.
                    2. Minimize the total operational cost:
                        total_cost = Œ£_t [ (price_buy[t] * import_kw[t] - price_sell[t] * export_kw[t]) * dt_hours ]
                    3. Ensure all constraints are satisfied:
                    - SoC at time t = SoC at time t-1 + (eta_c * charge_kw[t] - discharge_kw[t] / eta_d) * dt_hours / capacity_kwh
                    - soc_min ‚â§ SoC_t ‚â§ soc_max for all t
                    - 0 ‚â§ charge_kw[t] ‚â§ cmax_kw
                    - 0 ‚â§ discharge_kw[t] ‚â§ dmax_kw
                    - import_kw[t] = max(0, demand_kw[t] + charge_kw[t] - discharge_kw[t] - export_kw[t])
                    - export_kw[t] ‚â• 0 only if allow_export = True
                    - initialize the soc variable at soc_init at t=0, where t is the first hour of the day.
                    - The battery SoC at the end of the day should reach soc_target (if provided), else soc_init.
                    - Assume the battery can either charge or discharge or stay idle in a given hour, not both. So try to schedule the battery in such a way.

                    4. Output a JSON-compatible SolveResponse object with:
                    - status: "success" or "failure"
                    - message: optional diagnostic
                    - objective_cost: the minimized total cost
                    - charge_kw: list of hourly charge values (kW)
                    - discharge_kw: list of hourly discharge values (kW)
                    - import_kw: list of hourly grid import values (kW)
                    - export_kw: list of hourly grid export values (kW)
                    - soc: list of hourly state of charge values (fraction of capacity between 0 and 1)

                    Make sure the final schedule satisfies all physical constraints and the objective function is minimized.
