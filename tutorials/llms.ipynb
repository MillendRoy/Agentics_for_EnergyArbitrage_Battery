    "# Using LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the use of various Large Language Model (LLM) providers and tools for natural language processing tasks. It showcases how to interact with LLMs using the `crewai` library (which is used by Agentics), parse structured outputs with Pydantic models, and explore available LLM connections. The notebook provides practical examples for calling different LLMs, formatting responses, and integrating with external providers such as OpenAI and IBM WatsonX."
